\subsection{More about Spectra}

In this section, we will further explore the spectra of schemata. We begin by establishing that
\begin{theorem}\label{there-are-non-spectra-thm}
There is an $X\subseteq\mathbb{Z}^+$ such that for every schema $S$, $\spec{S}\neq X$. In brief, not every set of positive integers is a spectrum.
\end{theorem}
Our proof of this 
theorem relies on a deep result due to the nineteenth-century mathematician Georg Cantor:
\begin{theorem}\label{cantor-diagonal-thm}
Let $X_1,X_2,\ldots$ be an infinite sequence where for every $i\in\mathbb{Z}^+$, $X_i\subseteq\mathbb{Z}^+$. Then there is a set $X\subseteq\mathbb{Z}^+$, such that for every $i$, $X\neq X_i$. 
\end{theorem}
